# Lending Club Case Study

A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

(a) If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

(b) If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## General Information

- By using Exploratory Data Analysis in Lending Club Case study, we are looking to get some useful information from the historical dataset of loans given which can help us in identifying a defaulter in advance.
- The project started with an aim to reduce the losses by pre identifying defaulters and maximize the profit by identifying honest Borrowers.
- Business problem is to identify the Borrowers who are likely to default on loans by using the historical data available.
- We are using Lending Club Loan Dataset.


## Conclusions
- Approx. 15 % of Borrowers have defaulted on their loans, while  85 % have Fully paid their loans.

- As we move from Grade A to Grade G, interest rate increases and so does the loan defaults.

       This suggests that financial institution charges higher interest  rates for borrowers having poor grades

- It is observed that the Borrowers having higher incomes are less likely to default on their loans

- Higher the revolving credit utilization percentage of a borrowers, higher number of  loan default. 
 
- Loans taken for the purpose of Debt consolidation and credit card have higher number of default.
